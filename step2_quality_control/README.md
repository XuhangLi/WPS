# WPS quality control

## Introduction 
The dolphinNext pipeline produces a series of outputs. Two outputs are relevant to the downstream analysis, the bam files in "/star/" folder and the gene-by-barcode read count tables in "readsCount" folder. In this step, we use these two outputs to perform RNAi identity and sample quality analysis to safeguard the rigor in downstream biological analyses of the data.
